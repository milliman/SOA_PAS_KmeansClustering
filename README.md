# K-means Clustering Example
This repository provides an example of a k-means clustering algorithm, applied to R.A. Fisher's iris data set. 

The repository includes an R-markdown file (.Rmd). When the markdown file is "knitted," it produces the included HTML file, documenting
the code and its output. 

The code within an .Rmd file can also be run individually, and it can be edited as well.

The contents of this repository were created to supplement Session 10: Clustering Techniques at the SOA's 2017 Predictive Analytics Symposium.
